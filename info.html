        <p class="text-center mb-5">Clean water is very important for people's lives. But it is still scarce in many countries. In this section we explain why this is the case and how different areas use water. We also show what can be done to conserve water and improve its quality..</p>

                    <h5 class="info-title">Industry</h5>
                    <p class="info-text">Industries use water for cooling, manufacturing goods and cleaning materials. Because of this, the water often becomes dirty and is released back into the natural environment. If factories use old equipment, they waste even more water. However, modern technology helps purify water and reuse it. This reduces harm to the environment and helps save important resources.</p>

                    <h5 class="info-title">Agriculture</h5>
                    <p class="info-text">Agriculture is one of the biggest areas where water is used. Farms water large fields and give water to animals every day. In some places, the old way of watering is used and a lot of water can be lost because of this. This causes soils to dry out and plants get less moisture. New methods - like drip irrigation - help give plants exactly how much water they need. This saves water and keeps nature healthy.</p>

                    <h5 class="info-title">Households</h5>
                    <p class="info-text">In every home, people use water every day: washing hands, taking showers, cooking, washing clothes. In countries with good infrastructure, water comes directly from the tap, but in many places in the world it must be brought by hand from wells or rivers. This sometimes takes a lot of time and effort for people. If people learn to conserve water and use simple filters, they can improve their quality of life and reduce the risk of disease.

                    <h5 class="info-title">Power Use</h5>
                    <p class="info-text">The energy industry also relies heavily on water. Thermal power plants use it to cool equipment. Hydroelectric power plants run on water alone. If the systems are old, they waste too much resource and can pollute the environment. But new technologies can reduce water use and make energy production safer. Switching to solar and wind power also helps reduce the pressure on water resources.</p>
